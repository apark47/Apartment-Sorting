# Apartment-Sorting
Uses a MergeSort algorithm to sort a list of apartments by rent, distance from UCSB, and
condition, respectively. After sorting the apartments, it can determine what the most affordable apartment is, and can retrieve the best/worst apartments. I created this project for my Intermediate Python course in Spring 2023.
